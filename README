A test to show ReqestVar's behaving differently when they contain a String vs when they contain a Mapper object.

with a mapper object:
1) Go to http://localhost:8080/reqvareventlist
2) click edit
3) click submit
4) enjoy the NPE!!

with a string object:
1) Go to http://localhost:8080/reqvarstringlist
2) click edit
3) click submit
4) enjoy the lack of a NPE!!

Added a test to show closures around RequestVar's behaving differently from closures around regular objects:
- it appears that a new RequestVar object gets created every time the 'closure' is called whereas the regular object]
does not ....

go to http://localhost:8080/reqvareventeditonly (calls ReqVarEventEditOnly.edit)

console shows the following results:
